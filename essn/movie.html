    <h1>The Best Movies According to Sameer Kumar (meee)</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 favourite movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Cars 2006/ Cars 4</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite animated Family/Comedy movie. I just can't forget the amazing script-plot and crazy graphics/animations.</p>
    <h3>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (HP Series) </h3>
    <p>The best and never-forgetable Fantasy-Fiction movie series I have ever fell in love with and was not bored at all.</p>
    <h3>The Family Rockstar</h3>
    <p>One of the few Rom-Com movies that I adore alot, though for many its a simple rom-com, but for me its was super emotion bringing (relatable) and I also did like a similar movie Geeta Govindham.</p>
